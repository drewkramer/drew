<p>I am a self-taught front-end designer from the Philadelphia/Central Pennsylvania area. After going to school for teaching technology, and a short stint in the public school system, I pursued design, which was a passion of mine since I was younger. Since then I&rsquo;ve been priveleged with a variety of design &amp; developement opportunities from marketing agency to e-commerce for 5+ years. I love Jesus, my incredibly beautiful wife Bethany, drums, tennis, well-designed technology, and black coffee.</p>

                <p><strong>Hugo</strong>
<br>Incredibly fast static-site builder. Perfect for prototyping and launching static projects hosted on JAMstack servers such as Netlify.</p>

<p><strong>Bootstrap</strong>
<br>CSS framework that makes creating layouts fast and simple. It&rsquo;s also easily expanded upon per each design.</p>

<p><strong>SASS</strong>
<br>CSS on steroids. Variables, nesting, mixins, nuff said. I&rsquo;m also using a Sass plugin called Shevy to create a modular typography scale. Super handy.</p>

<p><strong>Cloudinary</strong>
<br>All media from this site is stored on Cloudinary. Serves images from their fast cdn and they have a lot of tools to make working with media easier, including serving responsive images.</p>

<p><strong>Gulp + npm</strong>
<br>Local server development + build automation. I&rsquo;m still learning the power, but these tools just make things way easier for development.</p>

<p><strong>Google Fonts</strong>
<br>I&rsquo;m using two type faces on this site, <a href="https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/butler">Butler</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Karla">Karla</a>. Karla is a great free font from Principal Design served up by Google Fonts, which is my go-to platform for webfonts.</p>
