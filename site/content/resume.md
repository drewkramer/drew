# Hello, <br>I'm Drew.
I am a self-taught front-end designer from the Philadelphia/Central Pennsylvania area. After going to school for teaching technology, and a short stint in the public school system, I pursued design, which was a passion of mine since I was younger. Since then I've been priveleged with a variety of design & developement opportunities from marketing agency to e-commerce for 5+ years. I love Jesus, my incredibly beautiful wife Bethany, drums, tennis, well-designed technology, and black coffee.
