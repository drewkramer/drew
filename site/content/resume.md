# Hello, <br>I'm Drew.
I am a self-taught front-end designer from the Philadelphia/Central Pennsylvania area. After going to school for teaching technology, and a short stint in the public school system, I pursued design, which was a passion of mine since I was younger. Since then I've been priveleged with a variety of design & developement opportunities from marketing agency to e-commerce for 5+ years. I love Jesus, my incredibly beautiful wife Bethany, drums, tennis, well-designed technology, and black coffee.

##### UI/UX Design 
Experience in website, app, and dashboard design.

+ I use with modern design applications such as Sketch, Figma, Illustrator, and Photoshop using artboards (or screens)
+ I have experience in designing from a modular based approach that is directly applicable to web or software development which includes style guides and design frameworks.
+ I have experience designing prototypes and working with developers to implement the design.
+ I believe that UI/UX design is just as much about designing something that captivates people as it is understanding that user base and their needs.

##### Front-End Web Development
Comfortable with designing and developing for the presentational side of the web. 

+ I have built many websites for Wordpress as well as static sites that run from a JAMstack server.
+ I have an advanced understanding of HTML, CSS, and an intermediate understanding of Javascript, PHP, ReactJS.
+ I am comfortable in environments using SASS, LESS, Gulp, jQuery, & Vanilla JS. I am always looking to learn more!
+ I am familiar with CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, Foundation, and UIkit to help expedite and systematize front-end development.
+ I've also had experience working in a ColdFusion environment as well.

**Hugo**
<br>Incredibly fast static-site builder. Perfect for prototyping and launching static projects hosted on JAMstack servers such as Netlify. 

**Bootstrap**
<br>CSS framework that makes creating layouts fast and simple. It's also easily expanded upon per each design.

**SASS**
<br>CSS on steroids. Variables, nesting, mixins, nuff said. I'm also using a Sass plugin called Shevy to create a modular typography scale. Super handy.

**Cloudinary**
<br>All media from this site is stored on Cloudinary. Serves images from their fast cdn and they have a lot of tools to make working with media easier, including serving responsive images.

**Gulp + npm**
<br>Local server development + build automation. I'm still learning the power, but these tools just make things way easier for development.

**Google Fonts**
<br>I'm using two type faces on this site, [Butler](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/butler) and [Karla](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Karla). Karla is a great free font from Principal Design served up by Google Fonts, which is my go-to platform for webfonts.
