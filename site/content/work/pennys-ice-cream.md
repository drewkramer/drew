lead: "Penny's Ice Cream is a local ice cream company owned and run by my brother-in-law and sister-in-law. They started with an ice cream truck a few years ago and now have a few scoop shop locations around Lancaster, PA serving gourmet ice cream and treats. They have a unique, fun aesthetic that I tried to represent through their branding."
