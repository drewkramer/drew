lead: "Waltz Vineyards is a local winery in the Lancaster, PA area that makes high-quality bordeoux-style wine; which is super hard to do in this climate region of the US. They break the stigma that great wine can't be made in Pennsylvania and are constantly shocking people with their product. I had the privilege of working with them to redesign their website and online shopping experience."

The site was designed in Figma, and built from the ground up in Wordpress. They use a third party for their online shopping cart, so I worked with their team to implement new design changes.
