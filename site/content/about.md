# Hello, <br>I'm Drew.
I am a self-taught front-end designer from the Philadelphia/Central Pennsylvania area. After going to school for teaching technology, and a short stint in the public school system, I pursued design, which was a passion of mine since I was younger. Since then I've been priveleged with a variety of design & developement opportunities from marketing agency to e-commerce for 5+ years. I love Jesus, my incredibly beautiful wife Bethany, drums, tennis, well-designed technology, and black coffee.

{{% content-block color="green" title="What This Site is Built With" %}}

**Hugo**
<br>Incredibly fast static site builder. Easy to learn and get started, especially if you're familiar with how Wordpress works. Currently using and loving the <a href="https://github.com/netlify-templates/victor-hugo" target="_blank">victor-hugo boilerplate</a>.

**Bootstrap**
<br>CSS framework that makes creating layouts fast and simple. It's also easily expanded upon per each design.

**Sass**
<br>CSS on steroids. Variables, nesting, mixins, nuff said. I'm also using a Sass plugin called Shevy to create a modular typography scale. Super handy.

**Cloudinary**
<br>All media from this site is stored on Cloudinary. Serves images from their fast cdn and they have a lot of tools to make working with media easier, including serving responsive images.

**Netlify**
<br>Publish static site projects. It's free, and their platform just straight up rules. Highly recommend.

**Gulp + npm**
<br>Local server development + build automation. I'm still learning the power, but these tools just make things way easier for development.

**Google Fonts**
<br>I'm using two type faces on this site, [Butler](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/butler) and [Karla](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Karla). Karla is a great free font from Principal Design served up by Google Fonts, which is my go-to platform for webfonts.
