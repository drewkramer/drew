# Hello, <br>I'm Drew.
I am a self-taught front-end designer from the Philadelphia/Central Pennsylvania area. After going to school for teaching technology, and a short stint in the public school system, I pursued design, which was a passion of mine since I was younger. Since then I've been priveleged with a variety of design & developement opportunities from marketing agency to e-commerce for 5+ years. I love Jesus, my incredibly beautiful wife Bethany, drums, tennis, well-designed technology, and black coffee.

**Hugo**
<br>Incredibly fast static site builder. Easy to learn and get started, especially if you're familiar with how Wordpress works. Currently using and loving the <a href="https://github.com/netlify-templates/victor-hugo" target="_blank">victor-hugo boilerplate</a>.

**Bootstrap**
<br>CSS framework that makes creating layouts fast and simple. It's also easily expanded upon per each design.

**Sass**
<br>CSS on steroids. Variables, nesting, mixins, nuff said. I'm also using a Sass plugin called Shevy to create a modular typography scale. Super handy.

**Cloudinary**
<br>All media from this site is stored on Cloudinary. Serves images from their fast cdn and they have a lot of tools to make working with media easier, including serving responsive images.

**Netlify**
<br>Publish static site projects. It's free, and their platform just straight up rules. Highly recommend.

**Gulp + npm**
<br>Local server development + build automation. I'm still learning the power, but these tools just make things way easier for development.

**Google Fonts**
<br>I'm using two type faces on this site, [Butler](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/butler) and [Karla](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Karla). Karla is a great free font from Principal Design served up by Google Fonts, which is my go-to platform for webfonts.

There are so many design and code tools available to help designers and developers work better and faster (more and more pumped out on Product Hunt every day), but here's a short list of my favorite tools that help with my specific workflow.

##### Figma
While Sketch might still be the industry standard screen UI design tool, Figma has been on the rise as a promiment tool in the area and is now my go-to. It's free to start, has cloud backup and version control, and real-time collaboration. I mean, pretty sweet if you ask me. The prototyping tools are also very good and easy-to-use. And last but not least, you can use it in the browser. Boom.

##### VS Code
I made the switch from Sublime Text to VS Code about a year ago mainly for the built in Git tools that VS Code had to offer, but quickly realized it has many superior features; including well supported extensions and an integrated terminal.

My favorite VS Code theme is the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wesbos.theme-cobalt2" target="_blank">Cobalt2 theme by Wes Bos</a>.

##### MacOS
Best operating system period. But, right now I'm currently exploring converting a Chromebook into a Linux local development machine using GalliumOS.

##### Adobe Photoshop
So much design magic in this app. Does pretty much everything that I can't do in Figma/Sketch.

##### Local by Flywheel
Amazing tool by <a href="https://share.getf.ly/k15s1g" target="_blank">Flywheel</a> to develop local Wordpress installs. The process is way easier than MAMP and you can sync your live installs to and from Flywheel, which is amazing. And it's built rock solid by Flywheel, which is definitely the best dedication Wordpress hosting platform.
