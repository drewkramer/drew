                <h1 class="">Hello,<br>I'm Drew.</h1>
                <p>I am a self-taught front-end designer from the Philadelphia/Central Pennsylvania area. After going to school for
                teaching technology, and a short stint in the public school system, I pursued a direction that had been a alternate
                passion of mine for some time. Five years of experience in user-interface design, front-end development, marketing
                strategy, and graphic design, I'm ready to carry this passion and God-given gift to new heights.</p>
                <p>I love Jesus, my incredibly beautiful wife Bethany, drums, tennis, well-designed technology, and black
                coffee.</p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Hugo</strong>
                    <br>Incredibly fast static site builder. Easy to learn and get started, especially if you're familiar with how Wordpress works. Currently using and loving the victor-hugo boilerplate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Bootstrap</strong>
                    <br>CSS framework that makes creating layouts fast and simple. It's also easily expanded upon per each design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Sass</strong>
                    <br>CSS on steroids. Variables, nesting, mixins, nuff said. I'm also using a Sass plugin called Shevy to create a modular typography scale. Super handy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Cloudinary</strong>
                    <br>All media from this site is stored on Cloudinary. Serves images from their fast cdn and they have a lot of tools to make working with media easier, including serving responsive images.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Netlify</strong>
                    <br>Publish static site projects. It's free, and their platform just straight up rules. Highly recommend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Gulp + npm</strong>
                    <br>Local server development + build automation. I'm still learning the power, but these tools just make things way easier for development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Google Fonts</strong>
                    <br>I'm using two type faces on this site, <a href="https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/butler" target="_blank">Butler</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Karla" target="_blank">Karla</a>. Karla is a great free font from Principal Design served up by Google Fonts, which is my go-to platform for webfonts.
